Project Details
The dataset contains historical product demand for a manufacturing
company with footprints globally. The company provides thousands of
products within dozens of product categories. There are four central
warehouses to ship products within the region it is responsible for. Since
the products are manufactured in different locations all over the world, it
normally takes more than one month to ship products via ocean to
different central warehouses. If forecasts for each product in different
central with reasonable accuracy for the monthly demand for month
after next can be achieved, it would be beneficial to the company in
multiple ways.

Project aimed at helping a global manufacturing company forecast how
much of their products will be needed next month. This forecasting is
super important for them because it helps them plan how much stuff to
make and ship around the world

Overview
This project uses a bunch of data that shows how much of each product this
company has sold in the past. We've got info on thousands of different products
they sell, and we're going to use this data to predict how much they'll sell next
month.The manufacturing company operates globally and offers a wide range of
products across various categories. With multiple central warehouses
serving different regions, the company faces the challenge of accurately
forecasting product demand on a monthly basis, particularly for the month
after next. Due to the complex supply chain and shipping logistics, achieving
precise forecasts is crucial for optimizing inventory management, production
planning, and distribution strategies.
